    "The CMU pronouncing dictionary, which is accessible using NLTK, contains information about the pronounciation of words. It is a dictionary whose keys are word types and whose values are lists of pronounciations (since words can have multiple pronounciations). In this exercise, your main task is to build a set of words that share a pronounciation with at least one other word (i.e. you should find words which are homophones). For example \"bear\" is such a word because \"bare\" has the same pronounciation. You don't need to remember what is a homophone of what, just that a word is a homophone of <i>something</i>.\n"
